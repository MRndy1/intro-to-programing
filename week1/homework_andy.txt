6. Payment Instalments
Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount of a purchase and the desired number of payment instalments.
The program should add 5 percent to the amount to get the total purchase amount, and then divide it by the desired
number of instalments, then display messages telling the user the total amount of the purchase and how much each
instalment will cost.

purchase = input("enter the amount of a purchase : \n")
instalments = input("enter the desired number of payment instalments: \n")
purchase_int = int(purchase)
instalments_int = int(instalments)
tax = purchase_int * 0.05
end_price = tax + purchase_int
per_month = end_price / instalments_int
print("the total amount of the purchase is", end_price)
print("the instalment cost per month is", per_month, "for",instalments,"month")


7. Miles-per-Gallon
A car's miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
MPG 5 Miles driven 4 Gallons of gas used
Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas
used. It should calculate the car's MPG and display the result.

miles = input("how many miles have you been driven: \n")
MPG = 4 / 5
print(MPG)
miles_int = int(miles)
gallons = miles_int * MPG
print("for",miles,"miles you have been used",gallons,"gallons of gas")



8. Tip, Tax, and Total
Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The
program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, then calculate the amounts
of a 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total.

food_charge = input("please enter the total amount of a meal you have been purchased at the restaurant: \n")
tip = int(food_charge) * 0.18
tax = int(food_charge) * 0.07
total = int(food_charge) + tip + tax
print("tips:",int(tip))
print("tax:",int(tax))
print("total:",int(total))

9. Circle Measurements
Write a program that asks the user to enter the radius of a circle. The program should calculate
and display the area and circumference of the circle using πr2 for the area and 2πr
for the circumference.
Hint: You can either use 3.14159 as the value of pi (π), or add the statement "import math"
to the start of the program and then use "math.pi" wherever you need the value of pi in
the program.

import math

radius = int(input("Enter the radius of the circle: \n"))
area = math.pi * radius**2
circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
print("The area",area)
print("The circumference",circumference)

10. Ingredient Adjuster
A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:
• 1.5 cups of sugar
• 1 cup of butter
• 2.75 cups of flour
The recipe produces 48 cookies with this amount of the ingredients. Write a program that
asks the user how many cookies he or she wants to make, then displays the number of cups
of each ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.


cookies =input("inter the amount of cookies do you want to make: \n")

sugar =  1.5 * int(cookies) / 48
butter =  1 * int(cookies) / 48
flour =  2.75 * int(cookies) / 48

print("this is the ingredients for",cookies,"cookies")
print(sugar,"cups of sugar")
print(butter,"cups of butter")
print(flour,"cups of flour")
