# Exercise 6:
#
# Magic Dates
# The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the
# following format, the month times the day equals the year:
# 6/10/60
# Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form),
# a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then determine whether
# the month times the day equals the year. If so, it should display a
# message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, t should display
# a message saying the date is not magic.

date = int(input("please input a date from 1-31: \n"))
month = int(input("please input a month from 1-12: \n"))
year = int(input("please input a two-digit year: \n"))

    print(f"the date {date}/{month}/{year} is special")
else:

# A class has two tests worth 25 points each along with a
# main exam worth 50 points. For a student to pass the class,
# they must obtain an overall score of at least 50 points and
# must obtain at least 25 points in the main exam. If a student’s
# total score is less than 50 or they obtain less than 25 points
# in the main exam, they receive a grade of “Fail”. Otherwise,
# their grade is as follows:
#
# If they get more than 80, they get a grade of “Distinction”.
# 50–59 = “Pass”.
# If they get less than 80 but more than 60, they get a “Credit” grade.
# If they get less than 60, they get a “Pass” grade.
#
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter their points
# for both tests and the exam and converts the values to integers.
# The program should first check if the points entered for the tests
# and exam are valid. If any of the test scores are not between 0 and 25,
# or the exam score is not between 0 and 50, the program should display
# an error message. Otherwise, the program should display the total
# points and the grade.
